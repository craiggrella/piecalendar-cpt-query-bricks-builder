# piecalendar-cpt-query-bricks-builder
This is a custom post type query for bricks builder query loop query editor to query pie calendar events from a custom post type.

## Plugins Required
There are several required plugins to make this work, including:
- [Bricks Builder](https://bricksbuilder.io)
- [Pie calendar](https://piecalendar.com)

You'll also need code or a plugin to create the custom post types. In this example, I've used [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com) to create the custom post type and custom taxonomy which are used in the query filter.

## Instructions
- In the query area of the query loop in Bricks Builder, toggle the selection for Query Editor (PHP).
- Add Code
- Sign Code
- Save
